title: "SponsorLink v2: A New Hope"
excerpt: |
  After collecting feedback from last year's attempt, reflecting 
  on many very valid points, I went back to the drawing board on 
  SponsorLink and I'm ready to start rolling out v2. Read on to 
  learn about what's new and entirely rewritten ;-).

Almost exactly a year after [my SponsorLink feedback post](https://www.cazzulino.com/sponsorlink-feedback.html), 
I think I have worked out most of the issues and would like to give this another 
try with a completely rewritten **SponsorLink v2**. 

A lot has happened in the intervening year, including valuable experiences trying 
to monetize OSS by other popular libraries (like [ImageSharp](https://x.com/James_M_South/status/1835172258198827204), PrismLib and others).
Many things stayed the same, though, including pitiful sponsoring uptick since I 
removed all traces mentioning the ability to sponsor my libraries from build and 
analyzer tools.

Just as last time, an obvious disclaimer first:

> I'm not speaking for anyone but myself. 
> I don't represent the "dotnet OSS community", or speak as to 
> "how OSS should be/is done" or what is "right" or "wrong" here. 

## Overview

The new v2 implementation is a complete rewrite and has reoriented several 
areas based on the [feedback I got](https://www.cazzulino.com/sponsorlink-feedback.html). 

Broadly, the following areas have been redesigned based on it.

### Privacy and GDPR

It was a pretty bad mistake on my part attempting to make SponsorLink work 
too "magically" last time and just "light-up" without asking users for explicit 
consent on what was being done, why and allowing easy opt-out, only made worse 
by a poor technical choice for user identification for sponsor linking purposes.

This time around, things are much more conscientious in this regard:

1. No network access is ever performed without user consent at any time
2. No network access is ever needed to check for sponsorship status
3. Fully random "installation id" is the only thing backend uses for telemetry
4. Sponsor linking is explicitly opt-in and requires multi-step acceptance:
   1. On a CLI console app that syncs sponsorship status, on first use
   2. On GitHub.com as an OAuth app that shows what information will be shared
5. Revoking access and opting out is similarly straightforward:
   1. CLI tool allows to remove all traces
   2. Directs users to relevant GitHub.com settings to revoke access
6. [Everything is OSS](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink).

An explicit [privacy policy](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/privacy/) is 
also provided, which is also shown in the CLI tool on first use.

It sounds complicated, but it actually is pretty straightforward:

```shell
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-sponsor
sponsor sync devlooped
```

> The same tool can be used by any other SponsorLink v2 self-hosted backend.

### Transparency

Another pretty bad mistake was attempting to make the system hard to circumvent.
This involved some really stupid ideas like making the sponsor checking closed 
source and obfuscated. Bundling this with OSS libraries was just the icing on 
the cake of bad ideas. 

The new approach is 100% OSS end-to-end: the sync tool, the backend, the sample 
analyzer, the manifest-based spec.

I have been asking for feedback for months now, and I feel the new approach is 
pretty solid. It makes things Just Work, without resorting to "security by 
obscurity" that we should all know is just dumb.

### Scalability

Rather than attempting to offer a one-solution-fits-all approach where other 
potential OSS developers/organizations would rely upon my implementation, the 
new SponsorLink v2 instead offers a manifest-based reference implementation 
only, which others may self-host. The tooling is smart to detect support for 
the manifest and invokes well-defined endpoints that can be implemented by a 
user or organization in any way they like. Self-hosting of the backend reference 
implementation is made (fairly) straight forward as an Azure Functions app, 
but there's no requirement to use my implementation at all.

Remote and local manifests are placed in well-known locations specified in the 
[spec](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/spec/), and they are [standard JWT](https://jwt.io) 
(down to the actual claim types used, such as `issuer`, `audience`, `roles` and so on).

Another piece of feedback was organization sponsorships and how that would 
allow easier scaling in scenarios where users are just forced to use certain 
libraries by their employers. 

**SponsorLink v2** now considers the following kinds of sponsorship "roles", 
in order of precedence: 
* `user`: the user is a direct sponsor
* `contrib`: the user is considered a sponsor because it has contributed to 
  the project via commits that have been merged.
* `org`: the user is a member of a sponsoring organization.
* `oss`: The user is a contributor to other active open-source projects.

Any combination of these roles can be present simultaneously.

In addition, the sponsorship tiers can provide arbitrary metadata that is 
then persisted in the manifest as JWT claims too. For example, I use the following 
metadata in my sponsor tiers as a hidden HTML comment:

```yml
<!-- 
tier: basic|silver|gold|platinum|bitcoin
label: sponsor ðŸ’œ
priority: 
color: '#D4C5F9'
-->
```

The CLI will show the resulting JWT as follows for a sponsoring organization:

![org sponsor](/img/sponsorlink-jwt.png)

These claims can be checked by developer tooling (analyzers, MSBuild, etc.) to 
selectively enable features, issue warnings and whatnot.

The `label` and `color` claims are used to tag issues reported by sponsors, for example.
I'm currently not using the tier for any particular feature toggle in any of my libraries, 
but it's there if someone needs the functionality.

### Fellow OSS developers

The last one (`oss`) can be opted-out by the self-hoster, but it's on for my organization. 
It is quite important because it means ALL contributors to *any* OSS projects that 
provide popular nuget packages (>200 downloads/day) are considered implicit sponsors.

I always thought it was a bit silly to ask fellow OSS developers to sponsor 
me when I'm likely using their great libraries in turn. This fixes it for good, 
so if you are an OSS developer (whether original author, regular or sporadic 
contributor), you will never have to sponsor me, unless you want to ðŸ«¶.

It was so important for me to recognize fellow OSS developers that I now 
[scrap nuget.org](https://github.com/devlooped/nuget) downloads at the beginning 
of the month and I host a page in the [SponsorLink docs site](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github/oss/) 
where developers (or organizations) can check their stats and even share them 
proudly via shields.io badges entirely serverless. 

How may packages/authors fit in that "popular" category? These are the live 
stats:

![Authors](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdevlooped%2Fnuget%2Fraw%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fnuget.json&query=%24.summary.authors&style=social&logo=nuget&label=Authors)
![Popular Packages](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdevlooped%2Fnuget%2Fraw%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fnuget.json&query=%24.summary.packages&style=social&logo=nuget&label=Popular%20packages)
![Daily Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdevlooped%2Fnuget%2Fraw%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fnuget.json&query=%24.summary.downloads&style=social&logo=nuget&label=daily%20downloads
)

That's pretty massive. If you have ever contributed to a popular OSS project, 
you're likely in that list. Feel free to check it out and share your stats 
from the [docs site](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github/oss/)!

### Benefits for users

It was also pointed out that it looked like sponsoring users didn't get any 
benefits beyond removing annoyances. The most egregious annoyance was a one-time 
(for the lifetime of the IDE) build pause. As an OSS-luminary friend noted: if 
you're building Swift code, the build pause will go entirely unnoticed since 
the build already takes forever ðŸ˜‚.

The previous analyzer-based approach is now just a sample that libraries may 
or may not adopt. If they do, it now involves a single solution-wide, IDE-only,
never-error (even with `WarningAsErrors`), per-product warning when sponsorship 
status is unknown. Just like before, this warning is never reported in CLI or 
CI builds.

But a few new areas are now integrated into SponsorLink:
1. Auto-labeling of issues and pull requests: there is even an extensible 
   mechanism to use custom labels depending on the sponsorship tier. This 
   feature allows improved prioritization of feedback and contributions from 
   active sponsors.
2. Real-time push notification of sponsor's issues and issue comments by 
   leveraging [Pushover](https://pushover.net).
3. Backing issues: one-time sponsorships can now be linked to an issue and 
   become the "bounty" for it, increasing the chances it gets prioritized 
   and fixed sooner. See [Back an Issue](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github/issues/)

For now, there is no automated distribution of the bounty to contributors 
that send a PR that fixes the backed issue after it's merged. I will consider 
this if it becomes too much manual work. For now, I'll do this manually as 
needed.

> NOTE: automating the distribution is non-trivial as it would require 
> automatically sending a one-time sponsorship to the contributor, and there 
> is no API to do that at the moment, AFAIK.

All these benefits can be trivially leveraged by other libraries that self-host 
the backend and configure it for their own sponsor account. This is documented 
in the [GitHub Sponsors Reference Implementation](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/github/).

I also feature active sponsors at the time of a package publishing in the 
readme itself (see [ThisAssembly](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ThisAssembly#sponsors) for example).
This involves fetching sponsor profile image, properly formatting it for display 
on nuget.org (i.e. square for orgs, circles for users) and with an easy to use 
[markdown inclusion](https://www.cazzulino.com/pack-readme-includes.html) mechanism.
You can explore the approach at [devlooped/sponsors](https://github.com/devlooped/sponsors/), 
the results being something like the following in every package I publish:

![devlooped sponsors readme footer](/img/sponsorlink-readme.png)

![devlooped sponsors readme footer](/img/sponsorlink-readme-light.png)

This is a nice recognition to the folks that make each release possible, although not 
specifically tied to SponsorLink.

## The Future

I was reminded recently that what I'm trying with SponsorLink will likely not 
bring me many friends, and may not even bring any significant revenue. I am 
aware of that. But still, I think it's worth trying. 

I'd like to continue [creating OSS content](https://www.cazzulino.com/sponsorlink-feedback.html#OSS-as-content-creation), 
so for now, I'll continue to pursue sponsorships as a potential income source. 
I appreciate the feedback on alternative approaches but in particular 
[ImageSharp](https://x.com/James_M_South/status/1835172258198827204) author's 
experience switching to a paid licenses (and trying paid support before that) has 
convinced me that that's not the path I'd like to take. As I mentioned in the past, 
you can tell [from my packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/kzu), 
[personal](https://github.com/kzu?tab=repositories&q=&type=source) and 
[organization](https://github.com/orgs/devlooped/repositories?q=&type=source) 
repositories that my interests are varied and I would like to continue to 
explore different things rather than set up shop around a single product/project.

### On Moq

I would still like to create a brand-new Moq. I have many interesting ideas to 
explore for it (see [Moq Rebirth](https://www.cazzulino.com/rebirth.html) from way 
back then) and smart ways to leverage SponsorLink to provide a differentiated 
experience to sponsors that makes it worthwhile to contribute, as well as innovative 
and extensible APIs I have been mulling on for a while.

To some extent, how much time I dedicate to it might depend on sponsorships 
taking off, so we'll see how v2 goes. 

I'm hesitant to reintroduce even this v2 in existing Moq at this point. I'll 
first collect feedback specifically for it and make a decision after a sufficient 
period (3 months? more? less?).

I've by now realized that most of the loud criticism was by a minority, and 
fellow OSS developers were actually quite supportive of my efforts. Downloads 
haven't even noticed the drama, so I think Moq's loudly predicted demise 
has been greatly exaggerated ;-)

## Closing thoughts

So, I've embarked on this journey again. I'm excited to see how it goes. 
I'd say most of the feedback I got last time has been addressed, in particular 
around privacy, transparency, organization sponsorships and critically (for me), 
recognition to other OSS developers.

If you are a .NET/C# OSS developer, just pause and think about it: there's only 
~35k of us, while there are millions of developers out there. 

![OSS NuGet Authors](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdevlooped%2Fnuget%2Fraw%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fnuget.json&query=%24.summary.authors&style=social&logo=nuget&label=OSS%20NuGet%20Authors)

SponsorLink is not about making money from the community, but from the companies 
and users that benefit from our work. It's an exploration of a different way to 
monetize OSS, which might arguably fail, but perhaps it will also succeed. And 
if it does, it's open for any of those ~35k authors to jump in too.

I'd love to get your feedback on this new approach. Please explore the 
[SponsorLink docs](https://www.devlooped.com/SponsorLink/) and let me know 
in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/devlooped/SponsorLink/issues/100)

Happy coding!
