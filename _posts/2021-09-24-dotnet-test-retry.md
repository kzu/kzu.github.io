title: "How to retry failing dotnet tests in GitHub Actions"
description: |
  When running dotnet test, there is no built-in mechanism 
  to retry failed tests. This post shows how to achieve this 
  with a bit of bash scripting that can run on all dotnet 
  supported OSes in GitHub Actions.

**TL;DR;**:

```yml
      - name: 🧪 test
        shell: bash --noprofile --norc {0}
        env:
          LC_ALL: en_US.utf8
        run: |
          counter=0
          exitcode=0
          reset="\e[0m"
          warn="\e[0;33m"
          while [ $counter -lt 6 ]
          do
              if [ $filter ]
              then
                  echo -e "${warn}Retry $counter for $filter ${reset}"
              fi
              # run test and forward output also to a file in addition to stdout (tee command)
              dotnet test --no-build --filter=$filter | tee ./output.log
              # capture dotnet test exit status, different from tee
              exitcode=${PIPESTATUS[0]}
              if [ $exitcode == 0 ]
              then
                  exit 0
              fi
              # cat output, get failed test names, join as DisplayName=TEST with |, remove trailing |.
              filter=$(cat ./output.log | grep -o -P '(?<=\sFailed\s)\w*' | awk 'BEGIN { ORS="|" } { print("DisplayName=" $0) }' | grep -o -P '.*(?=\|$)')
              ((counter++))
          done
          exit $exitcode
```

I had some networking-related tests that were (expectedly) kinda flaky. But rather than 
disable them in CI, I thought it would be better to just retry failed tests a few times 
to ensure good coverage and avoid unexpected *actual* failures. Unfortunately, the isn't 
a way with plain `dotnet test` to automatically rerun failed ones, and there isn't a 
[built-in task like in Azure Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/test/vstest?view=azure-devops) that will do that. 

So after a couple hours brushing up my (non-existent) bash-fu, I came up with the above 
script.

So, explaining what the above does beyond the obvious:

* `shell: bash --noprofile --norc {0}`: since the script detects `dotnet test` failures, 
  we need to disable [fail-fast behavior](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#exit-codes-and-error-action-preference) 
  which is [on by default](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell) 
  when using just `shell: bash`. The thing that does the trick is the `{0}` template string. 
  Here we just copy the other options that GH Actions uses by default, and exclude the 
  `pipefail` one which is the one that can trip the script.
  
* `LC_ALL: en_US.utf8`: I've no idea what this was all about, but it kept failing *just* on 
  Windows. So, [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61456142/grep-p-supports-only-unibyte-and-utf-8-locales-in-jenkins) to the rescue, and it Just Works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  
* `reset` and `warn` values: these are used to color the *Retry* message in the output. 
  It was another [trip to the web](https://techstop.github.io/bash-script-colors/#:~:text=Colors%20in%20bash%20scripts%20can%20be%20used%20to,Background%20colors%20can%20be%20used%20for%20section%20separation.).

* `tee` command after `dotnet test`: I wanted to let the test run output show in the console, 
  but also need to capture that output to a file to detect failed tests easily. That's precisely 
  what that [tee](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-tee-command/) command does.
  
* `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`: since I pipe `dotnet test` to `tee`, but I still want to get the 
  final exit code from the former, not the latter, so, [another learning](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14270/get-exit-status-of-process-thats-piped-to-another)! Since that variable is reset as soon as another pipeline is executed, I 
  need to capture its value in `exitcode`, for later reference when exiting the loop after 
  the 5 retries.

* `$filter`: you can pass an empty `--filter=` argument to `dotnet test` and it will happily 
  run all tests in that case. Which is why I can place it directly inside the `while`. The 
  [format for the filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/selective-unit-tests?pivots=xunit)
  is a pipe (`|`) separated list of `DisplayName=[TEST]`. Populating this as a single string 
  using a pipeline of various *nix primitives took a bit of time, but the result looks super 
  compact and clean. Let's go over it by segment:
  
  - `cat ./output.log`: just read the file written by `tee`
  - `grep -o -P '(?<=\sFailed\s)\w*'`: the output you see in the console when you run `dotnet test`
    contains `[xUnit...] DISPLAYNAME_OF_TEST [FAIL]` but the actual log doesn't have that format. 
    It's simply ` Failed DISPLAYNAME_OF_TEST [n ms]`, so I regex for that using a positive 
    look-behind. From what I gathered, the `-P` switch is required to allow for that kind of 
    expression, and `-o` means "output just the matched string, not the entire line".
  - `awk 'BEGIN { ORS="|" } { print("DisplayName=" $0) }'`: oh boy, concatenating all values from 
    `grep` with `|` took some digging. Yeah, I'm *that* newbie. But what this command does is 
    set the "record separator" to `|` before running the other "lambda" in a loop for each value 
    and concatenating them all. 
  - `grep -o -P '.*(?=\|$)')`: the resulting string from the concatenation contains a trailing 
    `|` at this point, and amazingly, there is no `TrimEnd` feature at all in bash. So, another 
    regex but this time with a positive look-ahead instead ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    

And that's about it. 22 LoC with no dependencies whatesoever and that can run everywhere.

Enjoy!
