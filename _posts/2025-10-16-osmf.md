  After another year with ~no traction for SponsorLink, its 
  time to try something different: OSMF, the Open Source Maintenance Fee.

Almost exactly a year after [my SponsorLink v2 post](https://www.cazzulino.com/sponsorlink2.html), 
and having virtually no traction whatsoever (besides a handful of sponsors, deeply appreciated!),
I'm announcing its retirement and replacement with a new approach: the 
[Open Source Maintenance Fee (OSMF)](https://opensourcemaintenancefee.org/). 

This approach is currently being successfully used by [WiX Toolset](https://github.com/sponsors/wixtoolset). 
You can listen to [this .NET Rocks episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4Q93lmZpES6d23XD76FJVW) where 
[Rob Mensching](https://x.com/robmen) discusses it in detail.

Please read his [Introducing the Open Source Maintenance Fee](https://robmensching.com/blog/posts/2025/02/26/introducing-the-open-source-maintenance-fee/) 
post for more context, as well as his [Open Source Maintenance Fee Two Months In](https://robmensching.com/blog/posts/2025/05/12/open-source-maintenance-fee-two-months-in/) 
where he shares his experience and reception by the community.

I'm not going to repeat all that here, but in summary: 
* I'll start adding an OSMF notice to my **new** OSS repos, as well as migrating ones using SponsorLink. 
* If you use a package/project containing the [OSMF EULA](https://github.com/devlooped/.github/blob/main/osmfeula.txt) 
  to generate revenue, the Maintenance Fee is required. 
* To pay the Maintenance Fee, [become a Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/devlooped) at the corresponding OSMF tier (starting at just $10!).

> If I ever decide to create a Moq v5, it will most likely use OSMF, 
> but I have no plans to do so at the moment.

Happy coding!
