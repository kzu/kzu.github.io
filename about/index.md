My name is Daniel Cazzulino. 

I'm the original co-founder of [Clarius Consulting](http://www.clariusconsulting.net), author of [Moq](https://github.com/moq), former [book author](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Daniel+Cazzulino), former [Xamarin team lead](http://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-acquires-visual-studio-division-of-clarius-consulting/) and former [Microsoft principal](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/02/24/microsoft-to-acquire-xamarin-and-empower-more-developers-to-build-apps-on-any-device/).

Around the web my alias is usually "kzu" (sounds like 'kah-zu' rather than 'kzoo', since the letter k is "kah" in spanish):
